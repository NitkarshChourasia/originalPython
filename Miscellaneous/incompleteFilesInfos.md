1. VE = 9 - To add extra features. Check what is up with it. Something fishy is here.
2. VE = 10 - To make it proper.
3. VE = 20 - Check to make it proper, that string thing in function's parameter can't seem to find it's functionality.
4. VE = 23 - Check and try to implement try and except and else and finally block if possible in such scenarios.
5. VE = 24 - Check the *correctness of the output*, later on.
6. VE = 29 - To implement some splitting feature and always output first letter as capital and rest as small letters.
7. VE = 31 - To implement a list1 elements checking to keep it about 0 or just 0 else false thing if found.
8. VE = 49 - Implement only str type inputs only.
9. VE = 52 - Implementation of only str type inputs only.
10. VE = 54 - Check the outputs and study the algorithms, properly.
11. VE = 88 - Flip the Boolean. Optimise the code, and improve the bool logic. <!--Important. -->
